## Data Set Information

Two datasets related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal, are available from the link above. For this project, only the dataset related with the quality of read wine samples is used. 

Link to the data:
```
wine_red <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijing-z/EDLD654-Final-Project/main/winequality-red.csv")
```
